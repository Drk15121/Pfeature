## Standalone Package of Pfeature
### Introduction:
Pfeature is a package for computing wide range of protein and peptides features from their amino acid
sequence and structure. It has the following five major modules for computing protein features based on
i)  Composition
ii) Binary profiles,
iii)  Evolutionary information
 iv)  Structure
 v) Pattern
 We have developed number of forms of Pfeature that include: 
 i) A web server that uses Pfeature functions via web interface from https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature/ 
 ii) Standalone version of Pfeature
