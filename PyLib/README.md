Library Package of Pfeature<br />
===============================

INTRODUCTION<br />
------------------
Pfeature is a standalone software package for computing wide range of protein and peptides features from their amino acid sequence. It has the following five major modules for computing protein features based on;
  - Composition
  - Binary profiles
  - Evolutionary information
  - Structure
  - Pattern
  
  We have developed number of forms of Pfeature that include:
  - A web server that uses Pfeature functions via web interface from https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature
  - Standalone version of Pfeature
  - Library of python for Pfeature and iv) Python scripts for computing features.
